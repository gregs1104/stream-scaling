Introduction
============

``stream-scaling`` automates running the STREAM memory bandwidth
test on Linux systems.  It detects the number of CPUs and
how large each of their caches are.  The program then
downloads STREAM, compiles it, and runs it with an array
size large enough to not fit into cache.  The number
of threads is varied from 1 to the total number of
cores in the server, so that you can see how memory speed
scales as cores involved increase.

Installation/Usage
==================

Just run stream-scaling::

  ./stream-scaling

And it should do the rest.  Note that a stream.c and stream
binary will be left behind afterwards.

Note that the program is only expected to work on systems
using gcc 4.2 or later, as the OpenMP libraries are required.

Sample result
=============

This sample is from an Intel i7 860 processor, featuring 4 real cores with
Hyper Threading for a total of 8 virtual cores.  It also features the Turbo feature
to accelerate running with low core counts.  Memory is 4 X 2GB DDR-1600::

Like many of the post-Nehalem Intel processors, this system gets
quite good memory bandwidth even when running a single thread,
with the Turbo feature helping a bit too.  And it's almost reached
saturation of all available bandwidth with only two threads active,
which is good for a system with this many cores; they don't all
have to be doing something to take advantage of all the memory
on this server.

Results database
================

Eventually it's hoped that this program can help build a database
of per-core scaling information for STREAM similar to the the
core STREAM project maintains for peak throughput.  Guidelines
for submission to such a project are still being worked on.
Please contact the author if you have any ideas for helping organize
this work.

In general the following information is needed:

* Output from the stream-scaling command
* CPU information
* List of memory banks in the system, what size of RAM they have, and
  what technology/speed it runs at.

Common places you might assemble this info from include:

* /proc/cpuinfo
* lspci -v
* dmidecode

Since CPU performance data of this sort is very generic, many 
submissions are sent to help this project without wanting the
company or individual's name dislosed.  Accordingly, unless credit
for your submission is specifically requested, the source of reported
results will remain private.  So far all contributions have been
anonymous.

Preliminary Samples
-------------------

Here are some sample results from the program, showing how memory speeds
have marched forward as the industry moved from slower DDR2 to increasingly
fast DDR3.  They also demonstrate why AMD was able to limp along with slower
RAM for so long in their multi-socket configurations.  While no single core
gets great bandwidth, when the server is fully loaded the aggregate amount
can be impressive.

Multiple runs
=============

Since significant run to run variation is often observed in stream
results, a set of tools to help average this data out are included.
The programs require the Ruby programming language be installed.
Using them looks like this, where we're using the server hostname
"grace" to label the files and averaging across 10 runs::

  ./multi-stream-scaling 10 grace
  ./multi-averager grace > stream.txt
  gnuplot stream-plot

A stream.png file will be produced with a graph showing the average
of the values from the multiple runs.  If you are interested in
analyzing the run to run variation, the stream.txt file also includes
the standard deviation of the results at each core count.

Todo
====

* Adding compatibility with more operating systems than Linux
  would be nice.  Some results have been submitted from FreeBSD that
  look correct, but the automatic cache validation code hasn't
  been validated on that OS.

* A results processor that took the verbose output shown
  and instead produced a compact version for easy comparison
  with other systems, similar to the CSV output mode of
  bonnie++, would make this program more useful.

* Some early cache size detection code has been written for OS X.
  But the program doesn't do anything useful there; it will just run
  normal STREAM many times.  The standard Apple compiler chain doesn't
  support OpenMP, and changing an OpenMP environment variable is the way
  core count is limited in this program.  You'll get this linker error::

  ld: library not found for -lgomp
 
Limitations
===========

On systems with many processors and large caches, most commonly AMD systems
with 24 or more cores, the results at high core counts will vary
significantly.  This is theorized to come from two causes:

* Thread scheduling will move the running stream processees between
  processors in a way that impacts results.

* Despite attempting to use a large enough data set to avoid it, some amount
  of processor caching will inflate results.

If the variation of results at high core counts is high, running the program
multiple times and considering the worst results seen at higher thread
counts is recommended.  Results listed above have included some work to try
and eliminate incorrect data from these processors.  That may not have been
entirely successful.  For example, the 4 X 6172 results show extremely high
results from 16 to 32 cores.  Determing whether those are accurate is still a
work in progress.

Bugs
====

On some systems, the amount of memory selected for the stream array
ends up exceeding how large of a block of RAM the operating system (or
in some cases the compiler) is willing to allocate at once.  This
seems a particular issue on 32-bit operating systems, but even 64-bit
ones are not immune.

If your system fails to compile stream with an error such as this::

  stream.c:(.text+0x34): relocation truncated to fit: R_X86_64_32S against `.bss'

stream-scaling will try to compile stream using the gcc "-mcmodel=large"
option after hitting this error.  That will let the program use larger data
structures.  If you are using a new enough version of the gcc compiler,
believed to be at least verison 4.4, the program will run normally after
that; you can ignore these "relocation truncated" warnings.

If you have both a large amount of cache--so a matching large block of memory
is needed--and an older version of gcc, the second compile attempt will also
fail, with the following error::

  stream.c:1: sorry, unimplemented: code model ‘large’ not supported yet

In that case, it is unlikely you will get accurate results from
stream-scaling.  You can try it anyway by manually decreasing the size of the
array until the program will compile and link.  Manual compile can be done like
this::

  gcc -O3 -DN=130000000 -fopenmp stream.c -o stream

And then reducing the ``-DN`` value until compilation is successful.
After that upper limit is determined, adjust the setting for
MAX_ARRAY_SIZE at the beginning of the stream-scaling program to reflect
it.  An upper limit on the stream array size of 130M as shown here
allocates approximately 3GB of memory for the test array, with 4GB being
the normal limit for 32-bit structures.

The fixes for this issue are new, and it is still possible a problem here
still exists.  If you have a gcc version >=4.4 but stream-scaling still won't
compile correctly, a problem report to the author would be appreciated.  It's
not clear yet why the exact cut-off value varies on some systems, or if there
are systems where the improved dynamic allocation logic may not be sufficient.

Documentation
=============

The documentation ``README.rst`` for the program is in ReST markup.  Tools
that operate on ReST can be used to make versions of it formatted
for other purposes, such as rst2html to make a HTML version.
